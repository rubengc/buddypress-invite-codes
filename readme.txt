== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is this plugin here and not on WordPress.org? =

Hi! I'm Ruben Garcia, author and founder of [GamiPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/gamipress/ "GamiPress"), some users has requested a similar add-on similar to the abandoned BadgeOS Invite Codes.

I just checked the code of this add-on and found that BadgeOS requirements are purely advertising and not a real requirement to make it work. This plugin doesn't makes any specific use of BadgeOS so the unique real requirement is BuddyPress now.

If you want to award your users by joining a group from an invite code, now you can use the [GamiPress - BuddyPress integration](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gamipress-buddypress-integration/ "GamiPress") or the BadgeOS community add-on.

= Are you maintaining this plugin? =

No, Our teams need to be focused in the development of GamiPress, this plugin is just focused on BuddyPress and we can't support plugins that aren't for GamiPress.

= Can I release this plugin on WordPress.org? =

Yes, If you want to adopt this plugin feel free to do it, but you will need to revise some internal functions to meet with the WordPress coding standards.
